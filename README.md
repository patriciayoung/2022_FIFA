# Project 3: 2022_FIFA
## Group Members: Dariel Ibanez, Mia Serrano-Salow, Nelson Velasco, Patricia Young

### Project Overview:
Our team is _____ uploading player data from the 2022 FIFA World Cup into a database for soccer scouts to use to determine the best players to rectruit. We have determined which players are the best based on their skills and performance in the 2022 FIFA World Cup. We have defined "best" by analyzing the relationships between players' number of goals, touches, assists, and passes, just to name a few. We have chosen to work in the sports field because it was a topic we all found interesting. 


### Questions:
1. Who are the players that outperformed their market value during the FIFA World Cup?
2. Who had the most number of goals out of all the players in the the FIFA World Cup?
3. Which players had the most touches per the amount of minutes per games?

### Applications:
For this project, we used Jupyter Notebook to clean our data and convert it into csv files. Dariel used polars and pandas in the Jupyter Notebook to clean the data. We used PostgreSQL and pgadmin to store the data.

### Location of Data in Github:
The name of the repository is 2022_FIFA. The original csv files with the raw data can be found under the "fifa worldcup data" folder. Our cleaning process in Jupyter Notebook can be found under "2022_FIFA_cleaned.ipynb" and the cleaned csv file can be found under "FIFA_stats_cleaned.csv". The data in the sql file can be found under "player stats and position stats.sql" and the ERD and its code can be found under "QuickDBD-FIFA ERD (1).png" and "QuickDBD-FIFA ERD.sql".
